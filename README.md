# Hello, World! (Yes, I know it's cliché) 👋

## About Me

Hi, I'm Christina - a long time technology professional who's finally joined the GitHub party! Think of me as that person who shows up fashionably late but brings really good snacks.

## My GitHub Journey 🗺️

```
Step 1: Create account
Step 2: Stare at empty profile
Step 3: Panic about having nothing to show
Step 4: Make this README instead of actual code
```

## Current Learning Goals 📚

- [ ] Make my first repository that isn't just a README

## My Stats (Don't Judge) 📊
